David and Edward

The homework overall was a lot more stressful than usual. Usually we have time to go over each part individually, but it was much harder 
this time because the homework was harder than usual. David did most of the cucumber area while Edward was writing the Rspec. After that, 
we wrote the code that tried to pass these test as best we can.
