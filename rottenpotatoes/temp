end

When /^I enter a movie that does exist$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should be taken to a separate "([^"]*)" page$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I click one of the movie results$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see the movie's information$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I clicked a movie on the results page$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I see the movie information has been filled out$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should be notified that a new movie has been stored in my database$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
